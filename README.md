# JavaNWordle
A variation of the popular Wordle game where you can choose the word length(4 or 5 letters), as well 
as the number of words you want to guess. Uses a simple text-based interface with color coding to display
the results as the game progresses. To play the game from terminal: zip src and res folders, extract the 
contents to a common folder. Navigate to that common folder from the terminal/command prompt, then type
"java -jar res/JavaNWordle.jar". This should start the game.
